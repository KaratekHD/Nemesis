  "7": "Don't leave me alone with them!!",
  "8": "Wenn du rennst, stirbst du.",
  "9": "Jokes on you, I'm everywhere",
  "10": "You're gonna regret that...",
  "11": "You could also try /kickme, I hear that's fun.",
  "12": "Go bother someone else, no-one here cares.",
  "13": "You can run, but you can't hide.",
  "14": "Ist das alles was du hast?",
  "15": "Ich bin hinter dir...",
  "16": "You've got company!",
  "17": "We can do this the easy way, or the hard way.",
  "18": "You just don't get it, do you?",
  "19": "Yeah, you better run!",
  "20": "Please, remind me how much I care?",
  "21": "I'd run faster if I were you.",
  "22": "That's definitely the droid we're looking for.",
  "23": "May the odds be ever in your favour.",
  "24": "Famous last words.",
  "25": "And they disappeared forever, never to be seen again.",
  "26": "\"Oh, look at me! I'm so cool, I can run from a bot!\" - this person",
  "27": "Yeah yeah, just tap /kickme already.",
  "28": "Here, take this ring and head to Mordor while you're at it.",
  "29": "Legend has it, they're still running...",
  "30": "Unlike Harry Potter, your parents can't protect you from me.",
  "31": "Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. If you keep running in fear, you might be the next Vader.",
  "32": "Multiple calculations later, I have decided my interest in your shenanigans is exactly 0.",
  "33": "Legend has it, they're still running.",
  "34": "Keep it up, not sure we want you here anyway.",
  "35": "You're a wiza- Oh. Wait. You're not Harry, keep moving.",
  "36": "NO RUNNING IN THE HALLWAYS!",
  "37": "Hasta la vista, baby.",
  "38": "Wer hat die Hunde raus gelassen?",
  "39": "It's funny, because no one cares.",
  "40": "Ah, what a waste. I liked that one.",
  "41": "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.",
  "42": "My milkshake brings all the boys to yard... So run faster!",
  "43": "Du kannst die Warheit nicht ERTRAGEN!",
  "44": "A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away... Someone would've cared about that. Not anymore though.",
  "45": "Hey, look at them! They're running from the inevitable banhammer... Cute.",
  "46": "Han shot first. So will I.",
  "47": "Hinter was bist du her, hinter einem weißen Kaninchen?",
  "48": "Der Arzt würde sagen... LAUF!",
  "49": "I take you to the Castle of Aaaarrrrrgggghhhh!",
  "50": "Das Enrichment Center ist verpflichtet, dich daran zu erinnern, dass du gebacken wirst, und dann gibt es Kuchen.",
  "51": "Ich werde dich killen und der ganze Kuchen ist verloren.",
  "52": "Spamst du wieder?!",
  "53": "Ich kriege dich.",
