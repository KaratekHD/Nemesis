  "DESC": "Your group's welcome/goodbye messages can be personalised in multiple ways. If you want the messages to be individually generated, like the default welcome message is, you can use *these* variables:\n - `{{first}}`: this represents the user's *first* name\n - `{{last}}`: this represents the user's *last* name. Defaults to *first name* if user has no last name.\n - `{{fullname}}`: this represents the user's *full* name. Defaults to *first name* if user has no last name.\n - `{{username}}`: this represents the user's *username*. Defaults to a *mention* of the user's first name if has no username.\n - `{{mention}}`: this simply *mentions* a user - tagging them with their first name.\n - `{{id}}`: this represents the user's *id*\n - `{{count}}`: this represents the user's *member number*.\n - `{{chatname}}`: this represents the *current chat name*.\n\nEach variable MUST be surrounded by `{{}}` to be replaced.\nWelcome messages also support markdown, so you can make any elements bold/italic/code/links. Buttons are also supported, so you can make your welcomes look awesome with some nice intro buttons.\nTo create a button linking to your rules, use this: `[Rules](buttonurl://t.me/{}?start=group_id)`. Simply replace `group_id` with your group's id, which can be obtained via /id, and you're good to go. Note that group ids are usually preceded by a `-` sign; this is required, so please don't remove it.\nIf you're feeling fun, you can even set images/gifs/videos/voice messages as the welcome message by replying to the desired media, and calling /setwelcome.",
